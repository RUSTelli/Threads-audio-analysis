## Description
This project focuses on developing a methodology for detecting hate speech in audio content on social media using machine learning approaches. We leverage language-specific models based on DistilBERT and integrate automatic audio transcription with OpenAIâ€™s Whisper to create an efficient pipeline for hate speech detection and classification.

## Characteristics
- **Audio Transcription**: Utilizes OpenAI's Whisper for accurate transcription of audio content.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Employs fine-tuned DistilBERT models to classify sentiments in the transcribed text.
- **Hate-Type Classification**: Uses hierarchical classification strategies to identify specific types of hate speech.
- **Language-Specific Models**: Benchmarks models in five languages (Italian, English, French, Spanish, German) with high accuracy ranging from 90% to 95%.
